# DSA-DOCUMENTATION
### Project documentation

This is where I started my portfolio building while taking my Data Analysis class
I am currently pursuing a course in Data Analysis at the Data Skill-Up Africa (DSA), where I have made significant strides in developing my analytical skills. Throughout the program, I have gained a solid foundation in Microsoft Excel, mastering functions such as pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and advanced data visualization techniques. These skills have enabled me to efficiently organize and analyze large datasets.

In addition, I have learned SQL (Structured Query Language), which has further enhanced my ability to manage and query databases effectively. This knowledge allows me to extract, manipulate, and analyze data to draw meaningful insights, making me comfortable working with relational database systems.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool. I am particularly excited about the opportunities Power BI offers for creating interactive dashboards and dynamic reports. I am focused on applying these skills to present data in a way that is both visually appealing and easy to comprehend, thereby assisting organizations in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights. 

- Overall, my progress in the DSA program has equipped me with a strong toolkit for data analysis, and I am eager to leverage these skills in practical settings.
