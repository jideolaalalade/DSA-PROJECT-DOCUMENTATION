# Amazon Product Review Analysis –Project Document 
## Introduction: My Learning Journey
Embarking on this data analysis project marked a significant milestone in my journey to becoming a skilled Data Analyst. I have been building my skills in Excel, pivot tables, data visualization, and dashboard design. This project allowed me to practically apply these skills to a real-world business scenario, analyzing customer review data to drive decisions.
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help sellers on Amazon make informed decisions by analyzing product performance and customer sentiment data. Working as a Junior Analyst at RetailTech Insights, I evaluated product reviews and metadata to generate actionable insights that can drive product improvements, marketing strategy, and customer engagement.
## Project Topic
In this project, the central focus is Amazon Product Review Analysis, which involves exploring customer feedback, product performance, and pricing data for products listed on Amazon. The goal is to help sellers and decision-makers gain data-driven insights into what makes a product successful, where improvements are needed, and how customer sentiment aligns with product ratings and reviews.
By analyzing thousands of products across multiple categories, this project identifies: Patterns in product ratings and review volumes, price strategies (discount vs. actual price), High-performing product categories, Customer preferences and potential market gaps
The insights gathered help improve: Pricing and discounting strategies, Marketing campaigns, Inventory planning and Customer satisfaction and retention
This topic is vital in today’s data-driven retail space where platforms like Amazon are heavily influenced by customer reviews and competitive pricing. Leveraging this kind of analysis enables sellers to stay ahead in the e-commerce market.
## Case Study: Dataset Description
• Source: Scraped from Amazon product pages
• Records: 1,465 products
• Columns: 16
• Fields Include: Product name, category, price, discount %, actual vs discounted price, ratings, rating count, review count, review text/title
Each row represents a single product, with aggregated reviews and performance data.
## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel:
- Data cleaning

- Visualizations
- Dashboard creation
## Data Cleaning Process
- Removed duplicates and blank rows
- Split and transformed comma-separated values into structured columns
- Standardized formats for prices and percentages
- Created calculated columns for metrics like potential revenue, rating × review count, etc.
- Binned products into price ranges using conditional logic
